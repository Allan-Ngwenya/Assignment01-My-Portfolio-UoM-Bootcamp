			      I am a training Full-Stack Javascript developer with cloud experience.
            </h2>
            <p>
            Learning about new technology and training to improve my skilset is something that I enjoy and take pride in doing. My tenacious drive and
            curiosity has recently lead me to embark on the journey of becoming a Full-Stack Javascript developer. I hope to combine the experience that I have
            working in cloud with some solid programming skills to become an all round engineer. Follow me on this journey and check out the cool projects I have 
            put together!

                <h2>Lloyds Banking Group - Public Cloud Site Reliability Engineer (July 2019 -August 2020)</h2>
                <p>
				        My interest in cloud computing and the implications of network security at the virtualisation level is something that drew me towards the role. Working in a big team with constant workflow means that on a regular basis I am learning new concepts and learning how to carry out a range of different tasks. As a young man in the early years of his IT career, I see the importance in developing my technical skills and stretching myself at every opportunity. My technical ability has improved at Lloyds Public Cloud, due to my constant involvement in; the provisioning different types of infrastructure (Virtual machines, Storage accounts and key vaults) with a range of industry recognised tools for compliance and automation. On a day to day basis I also build CI/CD pipelines, create/implement network security group rules, complete whitelist requests and work closely with industry recognised monitoring tools for cloud platforms. My management skills in a cloud engineering context are also strong, which is something I demonstrate at Lloyds Banking Group by handling our Vulnerabilities, SOC interactions.

                <h2>Lloyds Banking Group - Junior Java Developer</h2>
                <p>
				        Working at my previous lab has taught me how to be resilient in tough situations, calm in tense scenarios and how to work and learn simultaneously. My technical skills have been sharpened during my time at this Lloyds lab as on a day to day basis I was shadowing senior Java programmers and also developing/ testing code. My knowledge of the software development life cycle and agile development has grown at my time working as Junior Java developer. As an apprentice at Lloyds it was important to have an in-depth overview of what you're working towards as a developer, which is why I was also involved in IT architecture plans.

            <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
            <p>One of my first big projects using Javascript was Tic-Tac-Toe, a game which I made using HTML for the UI structure, CSS to make it look good 
				    and Javascript to handle the games logic. For more information on how I executed this project visit <a href="https://dev.to/bornasepic/pure-and-simple-tic-tac-toe-with-javascript-4pgn" target=”_blank” style="color:rgb(240, 10, 10)">Dev.to</a>
            </p>
			<h2>Intercative Map</h2>
			<p>My intractive Javscript map has some similar dynamic attributes to Google Maps, such as the ability to zoom in and out of locations.
				The game will be made using Javascripts framework JQuery to help familiarise myself with one of the most widely used libaries of code. If you'd like to have a try, visit <a href="https://codepen.io/aomyers/pen/LWOwpR" target=”_blank” style="color:rgb(240, 10, 10)">Codepen</a>

			<h2>To-Do List</h2>
			<p>Javascript is widely used in large organisations, and one of the roles I may find mysef in could require handling large amounts of user data a bit like the 'To-Do list' program.Test out your skills and stay organised!
